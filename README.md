# Vanilla-2019
Exploratory data visualisation and insights, from observation based data collecting, of a Vanilla cultivation. The vanilla flowers have to be manually pollinated in order to obtain the crop. The charts and their meaning are described in the Vanilla Research Paper pdf file. This project seeks to answer the following questions:
How many new flowers can be expected for the season?
How to plan out optimal manual pollination strategy?
