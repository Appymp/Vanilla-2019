# Vanilla-Analysis
Exploratory data visualisation and insights, from observation based data collecting, of a Vanilla cultivation. The flowers had to be manually pollinated. Pollinated flowers become vanilla pods. Please check the research_paper by finding the file in this repository.

The vanilla flowers have to be manually pollinated in order to obtain the crop. The charts and their meaning are described in the Vanilla Research Paper pdf file. This personal project seeks to answer the following questions:
How many new flowers can be expected for the season?
How to plan out optimal pollination day strategy?
